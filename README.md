> # 1 DOF prismatic robot arm
> This is complete of control part of 1 DOF prismatic robot arm, in this repostory will contain code  about the trajectory, controller, and state estimator. Each part will be split into a header file and source file.This code was implemented on STM32 f411re by C langue and and require DSP(Digital Signal Processing) for matrix calculation.
